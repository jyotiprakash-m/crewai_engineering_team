# Racing Game Backend Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the backend architecture and APIs for a car racing game to be implemented in a single Python module named `Racing.py`. The design includes a detailed description of the main class, methods, data structures, and considerations for edge cases, error handling, and extensibility.

## Main Class: Racing
### Description
The `Racing` class is responsible for managing the racing game, including the setup of the race, monitoring of player positions, handling race completion, and managing race results. It acts as the game controller, orchestrating interactions between various components like players and tracks.

### Attributes
- `cars`: A list of `Car` objects representing the participating cars in the race.
- `track`: A `Track` object that defines the course and its attributes.
- `race_status`: A string representing the current status of the race ('Not Started', 'In Progress', 'Finished').
- `results`: A dictionary storing race results with car ids as keys and their finish times as values.

### Methods

```python
def __init__(self):
    """
    Initializes a Racing game instance with default settings.
    """
    
def add_car(self, car_id: str, car_type: str):
    """
    Adds a car to the race.
    
    Parameters:
    - car_id (str): Unique identifier for the car.
    - car_type (str): Type of the car (e.g., 'sports', 'suv').
    """
    
def setup_track(self, track_name: str, length: int, obstacles: List[dict]):
    """
    Configures the race track.
    
    Parameters:
    - track_name (str): Name of the track.
    - length (int): Length of the track in meters.
    - obstacles (List[dict]): List of obstacles, each represented by a dictionary with details.
    """
    
def start_race(self):
    """
    Starts the race. Sets `race_status` to 'In Progress'.
    """
    
def update_car_position(self, car_id: str, distance: float):
    """
    Updates the position of a car during the race.
    
    Parameters:
    - car_id (str): Unique identifier for the car being updated.
    - distance (float): Distance covered by the car since the last update.
    """
    
def complete_race(self):
    """
    Completes the race, finalizes the results, and sets `race_status` to 'Finished'.
    """
    
def get_race_results(self) -> dict:
    """
    Returns the results of the race as a dictionary with car ids and finish times.
    """
```

## Helper Classes and Structures

### Class: Car
- Attributes:
  - `car_id`: Unique identifier for the car.
  - `car_type`: Type of the car.
  - `position`: Current position on the track.
  - `speed`: Current speed of the car.

### Class: Track
- Attributes:
  - `track_name`: Name of the track.
  - `length`: Total length of the track.
  - `obstacles`: List of obstacles on the track.

## Error Handling and Edge Cases
- Ensure unique `car_id` when adding cars.
- Handle invalid track configurations, e.g., a track length less than sum of obstacles.
- Prevent updates to car positions when race is not in progress.

## Extensibility Considerations
- Allow for additional car types and track features by keeping data structures flexible.
- Design for multiplayer functionality by adding network communication capabilities.
- Extend obstacle types and effects on races.

This design provides a comprehensive outline for implementing the car racing game backend, ensuring easy implementation and future scalability.
