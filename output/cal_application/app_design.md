# Design Document for Calculator Module

## Module: Calculator.py

### Main Class: Calculator
The `Calculator` class is responsible for performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It encapsulates these functionalities and provides a clear interface for clients to interact with the calculator.

#### Responsibilities:
- To perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- To handle and report errors when attempting invalid operations such as division by zero.
- To provide an extendable structure for additional functionalities in the future.

### Methods

#### Method: `add`
```python
def add(self, a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    Adds two numbers.

    Parameters:
    - a: float - The first number to add.
    - b: float - The second number to add.

    Returns:
    float - The sum of the two numbers.
    """
```

#### Method: `subtract`
```python
def subtract(self, a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    Subtracts the second number from the first.

    Parameters:
    - a: float - The number from which to subtract.
    - b: float - The number to subtract.

    Returns:
    float - The result of the subtraction.
    """
```

#### Method: `multiply`
```python
def multiply(self, a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    Multiplies two numbers.

    Parameters:
    - a: float - The first number to multiply.
    - b: float - The second number to multiply.

    Returns:
    float - The product of the two numbers.
    """
```

#### Method: `divide`
```python
def divide(self, a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    Divides the first number by the second.

    Parameters:
    - a: float - The numerator.
    - b: float - The denominator.

    Returns:
    float - The result of the division.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If b is zero, because division by zero is not allowed.
    """
```

### Error Handling
- The `divide` method should raise a `ValueError` when the divisor (`b`) is zero to prevent division by zero errors.

### Extensibility
- The class is designed to be easily extendable. Additional methods for more complex operations such as square root, exponentiation, or logarithms can be added without altering existing functionalities.

### Edge Cases
- The methods should gracefully handle edge cases like very large or very small values, ensuring the calculations do not result in overflow or underflow errors.
- Considerations need to be made for floating-point precision, as Python's `float` might not handle very precise decimal calculations perfectly.

This design outlines a coherent structure for the `Calculator` class and its methods, ensuring clear division of responsibilities and ease of further development.

This design provides a clear and comprehensive guide for an engineer to implement the calculator with basic arithmetic functionalities in a single Python module named `Calculator.py`.
