# Detailed Design for Todo Application in Python

## Module: `todo.py`

### Class: `Todo`

#### Description
This class will manage a list of tasks. Each task will have properties such as an identifier, a title, a description, and a status to indicate if the task is complete.

#### Methods

- **`__init__(self)`**
  - Initializes the Todo list as an empty list.
  - **Parameters:**
    - None
  - **Returns:**
    - None

- **`add_task(self, title: str, description: str) -> int`**
  - Adds a new task to the todo list with the provided title and description. 
  - Each task is assigned a unique integer ID.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `title` (str): The title of the task.
    - `description` (str): The description of the task.
  - **Returns:**
    - `int`: The ID of the newly created task.

- **`view_tasks(self) -> list`**
  - Returns a list of all tasks. Each task is represented as a dictionary.
  - **Parameters:**
    - None
  - **Returns:**
    - `list`: A list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains details of a task (ID, title, description, status).

- **`update_task(self, task_id: int, title: str = None, description: str = None, completed: bool = None) -> bool`**
  - Updates the specified task's title, description, or completion status based on the provided arguments.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `task_id` (int): The ID of the task to update.
    - `title` (str): The new title of the task (optional).
    - `description` (str): The new description of the task (optional).
    - `completed` (bool): The new completion status of the task (optional).
  - **Returns:**
    - `bool`: `True` if the task was successfully updated, `False` otherwise.

- **`delete_task(self, task_id: int) -> bool`**
  - Deletes the task with the specified ID from the todo list.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `task_id` (int): The ID of the task to be deleted.
  - **Returns:**
    - `bool`: `True` if the task was successfully deleted, `False` otherwise.

- **`get_task_details(self, task_id: int) -> dict`**
  - Retrieves the details of a specific task by its ID.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `task_id` (int): The ID of the task to retrieve.
  - **Returns:**
    - `dict`: A dictionary containing the details of the task (ID, title, description, status).

### Task Structure
Each task is stored as a dictionary within the todo list, with the following keys:
- `id` (int): The unique identifier for the task.
- `title` (str): The title of the task.
- `description` (str): The description of the task.
- `completed` (bool): A boolean indicating whether the task is completed.

This design provides a clear structure for managing tasks within the todo application, enabling easy addition, retrieval, updating, and deletion of tasks. Each method is designed to ensure that modifications to tasks are straightforward and maintainable. The `Todo` class encapsulates all necessary functionality for task management in a single module.
