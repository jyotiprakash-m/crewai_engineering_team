The argument against the motion that "Earth is round" is built upon questioning the reliability of the evidence presented in favor of a spherical Earth. Firstly, while astronauts have provided images that depict Earth as a sphere, these images can be manipulated or misinterpreted, particularly in an age where digital technology allows for alteration of photographs. Thus, we must question the authenticity of such images and whether they indeed represent reality or a manufactured narrative. 

Secondly, the hull-first disappearance of ships over the horizon could be attributed to perspective and atmospheric distortion rather than a curvature of the Earth. As objects move away, they appear smaller, and the lower hull may vanish from view without necessitating a rounded surface. This phenomenon can be observed with large structures or even the skyline of cities under certain conditions.

Moreover, the concept of gravity, which is often posited as evidence for a spherical Earth, is itself contentious. Alternative theories, including those proposing that gravity is a result of density and buoyancy, challenge the conventional understanding of gravitational pull being unique to a spherical body. 

The historical calculations by figures such as Eratosthenes, while impressive, did not necessarily prove a spherical Earth; rather, they relied on assumptions that might not hold true in light of current alternative interpretations of our world. The methods used assumed uniformity in the shape of Earth without adequately considering deviations that could support a flat model.

In conclusion, while mainstream scientific consensus favors a round Earth, critically examining the evidence reveals that the interpretation is not as definitive as commonly believed. Reasons such as image manipulation, interpretation of visual phenomena, and alternative theories on gravity provide viable arguments against the notion that the Earth is unequivocally round. Therefore, the motion should be reconsidered.
