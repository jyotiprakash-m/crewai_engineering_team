After carefully evaluating the arguments presented both for and against the motion "Earth is round," I have determined that the arguments supporting the motion are significantly more convincing.

The proponents of a round Earth presented multiple lines of evidence that build upon each other to form a coherent scientific framework. Their arguments include:

1) Direct observational evidence from space missions and astronauts aboard the International Space Station who regularly document Earth's spherical appearance
2) The phenomenon of ships disappearing hull-first over the horizon, which provides everyday observable evidence of curvature
3) The consistent behavior of gravity as a force pulling toward a central point, resulting in a spherical shape
4) Historical scientific measurements dating back to ancient Greece that calculated Earth's circumference using geometry and shadows

The opponents of the motion attempted to cast doubt on these evidences rather than providing substantive alternative explanations or positive evidence for a flat Earth. Their counterarguments primarily relied on:

1) Suggesting that photographic evidence from space might be manipulated
2) Proposing that the hull-first disappearance of ships could be attributed to perspective and atmospheric distortion
3) Claiming that gravity theories are "contentious" without providing substantial evidence
4) Questioning historical calculations without offering superior alternatives

The opposition's arguments were largely speculative and relied on casting doubt rather than presenting empirical evidence. They did not address how numerous independent space agencies from different countries all confirm Earth's roundness, nor did they explain how various natural phenomena consistently align with a spherical Earth model.

In contrast, the arguments for a round Earth presented multiple independent lines of evidence that converge on the same conclusion. The proponents provided observable, testable, and historically consistent evidence that has been confirmed through various scientific methods and direct observation.

Therefore, based solely on the arguments presented, I find the case supporting the motion "Earth is round" to be substantially more convincing and declare it the winner of this debate.
